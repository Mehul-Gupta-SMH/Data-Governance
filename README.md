# Data Governance Made Easy

Welcome to the Data Governance Toolbox repository! This toolbox is designed to streamline your data governance processes by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Large Language Models (LLM), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), smart engineering practices, and graph databases. With this toolbox, you can easily create Data Dictionaries, establish Data Lineage, and define Entity Relationships within your organization's data ecosystem.

## Features

- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Utilize state-of-the-art language models to automate the creation of data documentation and metadata.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhance data documentation generation with advanced retrieval techniques to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **Smart Engineering Practices**: Implement efficient and scalable solutions for managing data governance tasks.
- **Graph Databases**: Leverage graph databases to represent and query complex relationships between data entities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the toolbox's functionalities.

## Installation

To install the Data Governance Toolbox, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/data-governance-toolbox.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the configuration file according to your environment and preferences.

4. Run the toolbox application:

```
python toolbox.py
```

## Usage

The Data Governance Toolbox offers several functionalities to assist you in managing data governance tasks:

### 1. Data Dictionary Generation

Use the LLM-powered data dictionary generator to automatically create comprehensive documentation for your datasets. Simply provide the dataset as input, and the toolbox will generate detailed descriptions of each data attribute, including data type, range, and description.

```
python toolbox.py generate_dictionary --dataset <dataset_path>
```

### 2. Data Lineage Establishment

Establish data lineage to track the origin and transformation of data across various stages of processing. Input the source and destination datasets along with the transformation logic, and the toolbox will create a visual representation of the data lineage.

```
python toolbox.py establish_lineage --source <source_dataset> --destination <destination_dataset> --transformation <transformation_logic>
```

### 3. Entity Relationship Definition

Define entity relationships within your data ecosystem using the graph database functionality. Specify the entities and their relationships, and the toolbox will store and visualize the relationships using a graph database.

```
python toolbox.py define_relationship --entity1 <entity1> --relation <relationship_type> --entity2 <entity2>
```
